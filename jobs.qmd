e-OMIX has open positions for two collaborators.

# **Full-stack developper (m/f/x)**

### *Role*

-   Build bioinformatics pipelines processing single-omics data (mass spectrometry, high-throughput sequencing, etc.)
-   Develop solutions for the exchange and interoperability of large sets of biological data (in accordance with HL7 FIHR standards)
-   Develop and deploy specific modules to optimize experimental workflow, such as Quality Control or sample tracing.
-   Help with implementing automated or semi-automated statistical analyses

### *Qualifications*

-   PhD in computer science, engineering, data science or related field, or Master's degree with significant experience (5 years)
-   Significant work experience with the following tools:
    -   Object-oriented language (R, Python, C++, or similar language)
    -   Database queries (PostgreSQL)
    -   Development of web-responsives applications (Spring, Vue.js, Bootstrap...)
    -   Collaborative research software development (e.g., unit testing, version control, continuous integration, Git, etc.)
    -   Cloud architecture
-   Interest for biomedical data and topics
-   Ability to work both autonomously and within a team
-   Good written and oral communication skills, english proficiency

### *Additional assets*

-   Experience in biology, bioinformatics, healthcare informatics, or in any position involving biological or medical data
-   Experience with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
-   Knowledge with R Bioconductor package
-   Familiarity with open-source software distribution
-   French proficiency

### *We offer:*

-   A collaborative work environment: The project is conjointly led by the Computational Biology (CBIO) and Computer Engineering (INGI) units from UCLouvain and will involve other major academic actors.
-   The collaborator will be partly based in the [A6K startup incubator](https://www.a6k.be "A6K") in Charleroi, and partly home-based (with occasional travels to UCLouvain's Brussels or Louvain-La-Neuve campuses)
-   Flexible workhours
-   Reimbursement of travel expenses

### *Application*

Candidates are invited to send their application (resume and cover letter) to the [following e-mail address](mailto:contact@eomix.be) by March 1^st^ 2024.

# **Bioinformatician (m/f/x)**

### *Role*

-   Establish bioinformatics pipelines for preprocessing single-omics data (filtering, normalization, control of batch effect, quality control, etc.)
-   Adhere to interoperability standards established by the FIHR consortium Ensure compatibility of omics data collected across different platforms and research groups by implanting HL7 FIHR standards.
-   Integrate different types of omics data to favor multiomics approach\
-   Conceive and automate supervised (regression, variable selection, etc.) or unsupervised (network analyses, clustering, PCA, etc.) statistical analyses.

### *Qualifications*

-   Master's degree in bioinformatics, statistics, computer sciences, biomedical sciences, bio-engineering, or equivalent
-   Experience and/or keen interest in one or several of the following:
-   One or multiple omics experimental technologies, data processing analysis and/or interpretation
    -   interest in developing solutions for the exchange of biomedical data and in multicentric initiatives
    -   solid background in statistics, machine learning/artificial intelligence
    -   knowledge of one or more programming language (e.g., Rmarkdown, Python, BASH, etc.) and IDE (R, Jupyter notebooks, etc.)
    -   open and reproducible research
    -   collaborative research software development (e.g., unit testing, version control, continuous integration, Git, etc.)
    -   experience in R/Bioconductor data structures, in particular those used for omics data analysis (e.g., *SummarizedExperiment*, *SingleCellExperiment*, *QFeatures*, etc.)
    -   contribution to an open and inclusive research environment
    -   good written and oral communication skills, english proficiency
