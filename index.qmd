The e-OMIX project aims to develop and deploy a cutting-edge bioinformatic hub that meets the demand for integrated multiomics data solutions.

With the recent development of different type of "omics" methods (technologies able to characterize and quantify entire spectra of biomolecular content, such as DNA- and RNA-sequencing, mass spectrometry applied to proteins, etc.), biologists have been able to generate large datasets accounting for a wide range of cellular processes. Integrating these different streams of data however, revealed to be an arduous task, both for technical and theoretical reasons.

e-OMIX strives to overcome these obstacles by combining the integration, management, storage, sharing and analysis of different types of multiomics data in a single platform. The end product will be a set of open-source tools tailored for local academic institutions, healthcare networks and R&D departments conducting either fundamental or applied research, with the ambition to drive the development of new therapeutics, help identifying novel biomarkers, and accelerate the comprehension of complex cellular processes.
