**The e-OMIX project aims to develop and deploy a cutting-edge bioinformatic platform that meets the demand for omics analyses, storage and sharing of omics data and metadata, and integration of multiple omic levels.**

With the recent development of different type of omics technologies (methods to characterize and quantify entire spectra of biomolecular content, such as DNA- and RNA-sequencing, mass spectrometry applied to proteins, etc.), biologists have been able to generate large datasets accounting for a wide range of cellular processes. Despite the tremendous impact these technologies have brought to the field of biology and medicine, they often necessitate specialized knowledge in bioinformatics and statistics. With e-OMIX, we strive to provide an accessible environment, where different type of omics data could be analyzed without the need for complex tools or programming language. Moreover, e-OMIX will provide solutions for the storage and sharing of the resulting data, using a mix of innovative database technologies and interoperability standards.

<!-- The e-OMIX project aims to develop and deploy a cutting-edge bioinformatic hub that meets the demand for integrated multiomics data solutions. -->

<!-- With the recent development of different type of "omics" methods (technologies able to characterize and quantify entire spectra of biomolecular content, such as DNA- and RNA-sequencing, mass spectrometry applied to proteins, etc.), biologists have been able to generate large datasets accounting for a wide range of cellular processes. Integrating these different streams of data however, revealed to be an arduous task, both for technical and theoretical reasons. -->

<!-- e-OMIX strives to overcome these obstacles by combining the integration, management, storage, sharing and analysis of different types of multiomics data in a single platform. The end product will be a set of open-source tools tailored for local academic institutions, healthcare networks and R&D departments conducting either fundamental or applied research, with the ambition to drive the development of new therapeutics, help identifying novel biomarkers, and accelerate the comprehension of complex cellular processes. -->
